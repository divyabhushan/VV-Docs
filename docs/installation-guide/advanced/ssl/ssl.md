**SSL** is an acronym for **Secure Socket Layer**.
SSL certificates create a foundation of trust by establishing a secure connection. To assure visitors their connection is secure, browsers provide special visual cues that range anything from a green padlock to branded URL bar.
SSL certificates have a key pair: a public and a private key. These keys work together to establish an encrypted connection.

## Considerations 
**What are the things needed to be considered, if everything even the BI Platforms needs to be in SSL, things about Self Signed SSL**.

It is always recommended to use SSL wherever it is supported & allowed.
It is a security recommended practice to use SSL when you are handling logins and credentials so that they would not be transmitted over networks in plaintext form.
There is no difference in terms of security provided by the Self-Signed certificate versus the Publicly Trusted certificate except for the Certificate Authority (CA) which signs the certificate.
For Self-Signed certificates, the CAâ€™s root certificate should be internally trusted across all systems which will be accessing the website.

## Format of SSL supported and how to convert from one format to another
There are multiple types of encoding supported in SSL and their use cases vary with platform and web servers.
The common ones that are widely supported would be **PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail)** & **DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules)**.

Here is a simple example for converting a DER certificate into PEM:

```bash
openssl x509 -inform der -in der_certificate.cer -out pem_certificate.crt
```
