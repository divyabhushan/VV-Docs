If you didnâ€™t get the webpage response then kindly follow the steps below to troubleshoot 

* Verify whether the instance is in running state in Configuration Utility.
* Also verify that the Server instance service is running by opening up the `Start > Run > Services.msc`
* Open the log files which could be found in `<installation folder>/server/log/app-log/<instance_name>.log`.
* Check the log files for any errors. 
:::note
For more information you have to set the log type. Please change the **Log Level** as **info** in the **General Section** of the **Configuration Utility**.
Remember to restart the instance after changing the value.
:::

* If you have enabled SSL, verify whether you have a valid SSL certificate. Check the logs for any SSL certificate error. If there is an SSL certificate error, the Server instance will fall back to HTTP. You could verify by visiting the HTTP URL.
* Verify the log if there are any database connection errors.
