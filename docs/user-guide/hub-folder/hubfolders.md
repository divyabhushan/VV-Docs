The Hub Folders menu will list down all the Folders/Reports that are being created in the Reports Menu by the Admin user. Here the user can view all the folders/reports and move the selected folders/reports to any folder in “My Folders” page that has been already created by the user.

For our example, the folder “Oil & Gas” has the Report “AO_Downtime_demo”. Now you can move this folder “Oil & Gas” or Report “AO_Downtime_demo” to the user created folder “Testing” in the My Folders page. For our example, the Report has been selected to get moved to the Testing Folder (see Figure below).

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="Report selection" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/user-guide/vbi2.png')}/>
    </Zoom>
  </div>

*Report selection*

After clicking the “Add To My Folders” option, you need to specify to which folder the selected Report “AO_Downtime_demo” needs to be moved (see Figure below).

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="Folder selection" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/user-guide/vbi3.png')}/>
    </Zoom>
  </div>

*Folder selection*

For our example Testing Folder has been selected and now the Report “AO_Downtime_demo” has been moved to Testing Folder in My Folders page as shown below.

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="Report moved to My Folders" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/user-guide/vbi4.png')}/>
    </Zoom>
  </div>

*Report moved to My Folders*
