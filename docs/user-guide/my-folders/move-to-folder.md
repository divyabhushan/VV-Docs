You can also move the already created Folder/Reports to a different Folder based on your choice. For our example, using the “Move To” option you can move the Folder 2 to Folder 1 as shown in the below screen. The Folder 2 has been selected.

  <div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="Move To Folder" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/user-guide/folder5_.png')}/>
    </Zoom>
  </div>

*Move To Folder*

After clicking the “Move To” option then you need to specify to which Folder the selected Folder 2 needs to be moved (see Figure below).

  <div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="Move To Folder" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/user-guide/folder6_.png')}/>
    </Zoom>
  </div>

*Move To Folder*

For our example Folder 1 has been selected and now the Folder 2 has been moved to Folder 1 as shown below.

  <div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="Move To Folder" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/user-guide/folder7_.png')}/>
    </Zoom>
  </div>
