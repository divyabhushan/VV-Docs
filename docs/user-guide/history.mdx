In the **History** section, you can see a list of **Recently Viewed** and **Most Viewed** reports by all the users across the platform.

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="Recently viewed Reports" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/user-guide/ht2.png')}/>
    </Zoom>
    <p>Recently viewed Reports</p>
  </div>

This gives you a quick insight on the important reports and allows you to add them to **My Folders/Favorites/comment** or view report details.
