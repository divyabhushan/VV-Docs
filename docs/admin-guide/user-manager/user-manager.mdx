This section can be used by an Administrator to add users manually from Microsoft AD to BI Hub. Click on User Manager from the application pane.

## Add New User

1. Click on Add User on the right top as shown below.

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>

    </Zoom>
	<p>Add User</p>
  </div>

1. Enter **Fullname**, and select: 
   - **Native** to add a user who will be authenticated by BI Hub (because the user is currently authenticated by BI platforms and not AD).
