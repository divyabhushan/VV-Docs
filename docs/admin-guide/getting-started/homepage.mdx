Upon successfully configuring the Agents, connecting the directory services, and a few successful synchronizations, the landing page displays four tiles:

- **Instances configured** – List of instances under the agents being configured and their status.
- **Authentications configured** – List of user authentications.
- **Components configured** – List of components like Elastic Search, Message Queue, and SMTP.
- **Synchronization Information** – Synchronization details for users, reports and authentication. The administrator can check here for recent activities that happened in BI Hub. To view the recent activities over a period, the administrator can click on the calendar icon and provide a date range as input.
