BI Hub accepts administrator profile information such as picture, email address, division/department to which the administrator belongs to and the theme (dark/light). These attributes are accepted when the administrator does a login for the first time along with the Change Password page. Note that the Email ID is mandatory, and the profile picture can be of only .jpg format and 100kb in size. This email address is used in the ‘Access Requests’ generated by the user in Smart Search feature as the From address, the To: email address is the address specified in the Agent instance and the User gets a copy of the request.

BI Hub administrator can modify the email address, division, picture and theme using Profile Settings. Administrator can modify his/her password using instructions available in Section adminutilities of this document.
