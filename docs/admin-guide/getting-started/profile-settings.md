BI Hub accepts administrator profile information such as picture, email address, division/department to which the administrator belongs to and the theme (dark/light). These attributes are accepted when the administrator does a login for the first time along with the Change Password page. 

> Email ID is mandatory. (This email address is used in the ‘Access Requests’ generated by the user in Smart Search feature as the From address, the To: email address is the address specified in the Agent instance and the User gets a copy of the request.)
> 
> The Profile picture must be in `.jpg` format and the recommended size is `584 X 400` px.
