In the **General** page, an admin can configure general settings related to application navigation, security, reports, and agents.

Following are the configurations available in the General page:

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="Admin page's general settings" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/admin-guide/settings/general-settings.png')}/>
    </Zoom>
    <p>General Settings on the admin's page</p>
  </div>

## Navigation

To customize the **Navigation Panel** for other users, the super Admin can:

- **Drag to rearrange** the navigation menus by selecting the drag and order ( <img width="20" src={useBaseUrl('img/drag-order.png')}/> ) icon.
- **Rename** the navigation labels by selecting the edit ( <img width="20" src={useBaseUrl('img/edit.png')}/> ) icon.
- Enable/disable the navigation menus with the **ON/OFF** toggle.

Navigation menu for all users will appear in the order and with the names as set by an admin in this section.

## User Specific - Report Sync

You can now enable/disable the **Sync Reports** feature for the users in their BI Hub profile.
To do so, use the **User Specific - Report Sync** toggle ON/OFF.

## Security - Password Strength Validator

Admin can set the native user password strength validator under **Settings > General > Security** section.
The values can be set to "Low/Medium/High" (Tooltip in the app provides the details of the security settings).

> Any new user created must adhere to the password validation rules to set the new password string.

## Search

By default the **Search** section allows users to search and request the reports they do not have access to.

To hide listing the inaccessible reports, turn OFF the **Show Inaccessible reports** toggle here.

When the users search for the reports, the **Inaccessible** reports would be visible or hidden based on the selection made by the Admin.

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="Inaccessible Reports" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/admin-guide/settings/inaccessible-reports.png')}/>
    </Zoom>
    <p>Inaccessible Reports view</p>
  </div>

## Views

By default, the **Show Agent Instance** is enabled for each report for all the users.
To hide the agent instance, turn OFF this toggle.

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="Report with Instance Agent Display" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/admin-guide/settings/view-instance-name.png')}/>
    </Zoom>
    <p>Report with Instance Agent name displayed</p>
  </div>

## Customization

You allow users to **Launch Reports In New Tab** with the ON/OFF toggle.

- When you enable this option, by default **Open Report in new tab** is enabled for the users when they login for the first time.
- The user can later choose to enable/disable this option from **Settings > Customization Settings** section.

:::note
User customized settings take precedence over customizations done by Admin.
