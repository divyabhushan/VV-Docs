These utilities help the Server Administrator to perform actions such as change the admin password and set-up scheduled synchronization between BI Hub and BI platforms.

## Synchronization Information

A summary of "Sync Authentication", "Sync Reports", and "Sync Users",  is displayed on the **Home** page of the Admin's BI Hub application.

  <div class="center">
    <Zoom>
      <img alt="Agent Manager" src={useBaseUrl('doc-images/admin-guide/admin-utilities/synch-info.png')}/>
    </Zoom>
    <p>Agent Manager main screen</p>
  </div>

- The sync utilities executed by the Server Admin is listed as **"Bot"** in the **Last Updated By** column.
- The Utilities run by an Admin from BI Hub app are listed as **"Admin"** in the **Last Updated By** column.
