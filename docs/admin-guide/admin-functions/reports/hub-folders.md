In addition to classifying the reports by platform, they can also be classified functionally. This can be done by using Hub Folders.

New Folder pane opens on the right where you can enter the folder name.

To classify the Reports across the platforms, go to the platform folders in
Reports Menu and enter a search term "time" in the search box. All the
reports that have the word "time" in their Name, Description, BI
Platform Path are displayed here. Select the reports that you wish to
classify and click on **Add to Hub Folders** and move to the required
folder.
