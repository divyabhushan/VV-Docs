Smart search is a feature by which the users can see set of reports that are not accessible to them but accessible to other users and can request access for the reports. This can be configured at the agent level. The smart search toggle in the instance manager is enabled by default which
allows all users to utilize the ‘Not Accessible’ feature. Administrator can turn off this toggle for an agent and that will prevent all users of BI Hub from seeing a list of not accessible reports for that agent.
